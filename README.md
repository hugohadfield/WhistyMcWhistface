WhistyMcWhistface is an implementation of the rules of contract whist along with useful functionality for writing bots to play the game.

The current state of the art on the platform SnakeMonteCarloPlayer performs a monte carlo simulation of future moves and plays to maximise the lead of the AI agent over the highest scoring other player in the game

Some limited GUI functionality is provided via the easygui library
